Welcome to your first MDX post on Quantum Machine Learning.

## ⚛️ What is QML?

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) blends:

- Quantum Computing  
- Classical Optimization  
- Machine Learning models  

QML algorithms rely heavily on **parameterized quantum circuits** and **gradient-based optimization**.

## 🧠 Key Idea

A classical optimizer updates parameters, while the quantum computer evaluates the cost function.

This creates a hybrid loop:
