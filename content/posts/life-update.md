## 🔍 What Does This Guide Cover?

This practical guide focuses on applying QML to real-world workflows.

### 1️⃣ Data Encoding

How to map classical data into quantum states:

- Angle encoding
- Amplitude encoding
- Basis encoding

### 2️⃣ Variational Circuits

Variational circuits allow **learning** through tunable parameters:

```python
# Example Pennylane variational layer
import pennylane as qml
import numpy as np

theta = np.random.random()

@qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2))
def circuit():
    qml.RY(theta, wires=0)
    qml.CNOT(wires=[0,1])
    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
